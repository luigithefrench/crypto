## Description
This is CRYPTO. A project created by students of the University of Applied Sciences St. Pölten. CRYPTO’s design and appearance were inspired by the AI “Jarvis”, who appeared in the Marvel superhero movies and was created by Tony Stark. 

The aim of this project was to map our incoming voice onto a 3D sphere and enable some interaction. This was made possible by creating three jit.gl.mesh objects - a sphere, some lines and dots – and combining them into one jit.gl.world. 

In order to initiate an interaction, a face has to be recognised via the webcam. As soon as this happens, CRYPTO awakes from its sleeping mode and appears in its true and colourful  form. In this awaken mode, our voice gets mapped onto the three combined jit.gl.mesh objects, and they start transforming themselves according to the frequencies in our voice. 


## Work allocation
We have decided to work together as a team for most of this project. This means that eve-rybody was present for most of the time and tasks. This results in us gaining the maximum of experience from this project. However, there have been some times when the individual experts did small tasks on their own.
